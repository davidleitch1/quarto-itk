# challenges for a listed renewable developer {.scrollable}
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- infrastructure owner wants a steady predictable return
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
  - capital commitments are large and ongoing
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- developer wants a higher because riskier return on capital

:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

  - lower capital requirement higher people skills

:::

## Company


::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

  - Return on capital never obvious 
  - So yield is the signal to investors but needs to be pre tax
  - constant issue of capital dilutes control

:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Trust and developer or stapled security

:::




## Trust 

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

- distributes cash, doesn't worry about profit for distribution
- pre tax basis

:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
  - Trust managed by holding company
    - develops and sells into trust

:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
  - Stapled security
    - trust and holding company indivisibly stapled together

:::

## Examples

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

  Property trusts, Transurban, Spark Infrastructure, Ausnet
