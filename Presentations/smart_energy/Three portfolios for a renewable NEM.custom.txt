## Three portfolios for a renewable NEM

- Best wind and solar portfolio.
  - Best = maximise (average output/variability of output) = Professor Bill Sharpe's ratio regardless of transmission cost
  - Lots of wind in North Qld, Tasmania and Sth Aust, some offshore wind
- Lowest cost portfolio
  - Includes wind, solar, batteries, gas(capaital and fuel), transmission and existing hydro costs
  - Much more solar and gas
- ITK's preferred portfolio, (perfect is the enemy of the good)
  - minimises gas (ie carbon), cost is still low, Sharpe ratio high
  - Lots of wind but closer to load to reduce transmission

## Takehome

- Rooftop can't do it all
- Tasmania and QLD are essential to an efficient decarbonised NEM
- More solar probably means more firming and more gas
