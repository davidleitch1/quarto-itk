## Markdown Proofreading Workflow

When asked to proofread a .md file:

1. Read the file and analyze for:
   - Spelling mistakes
   - Double/duplicate words
   - Grammar errors
   - Missing apostrophes in contractions
   - Incorrect word usage (less/fewer, etc.)
   - Broken markdown links

2. Present proposed changes in a numbered list with checkboxes
3. Wait for user approval of each change
4. Apply only approved changes
5. Generate final change log

## Common Error Patterns to Look For:
- "cant" → "can't"
- "wont" → "won't" 
- "Thats" → "That's"
- "less [countable noun]" → "fewer [countable noun]"
- Duplicate words like "by by", "as as", "be either be"
- Misspelled words: "accomodation", "Neverthe less"
- Broken markdown links with missing characters
