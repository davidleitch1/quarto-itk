### 10 July

Late night, long morning moved site deployment to GitHub for speedier updating of the site using the Netlify actions. And reorganised main menus to better suit phones etc.

###  9 July

Wrote a [note](https://itkservices3.com/posts/data_centre_location.html) looking at locating a datacentre in the Riverina next to say Dinawan substation, was pleased to make quite a nice waterfall chart building up the weighted average cost of power.

### 5 July

Starting the complex process of changing my personal email and moving my work email from host to another. This involved Siteground, Cloudflare, TPP and Fastmail wand would have been completely impossible for me without the detailed assistance of both Claude and ChatGPT. Claude's ability to look at screenshots so as to check whether the various mail records MX, C, TXT have been entered properly was completely essential. Hopefully its done now.

### 3 July

Starting to track site visits etc with plausible.IO. Also added a price chart to the new operational supply dashboard. Timely given the South Australia price averaged close to \$2000 over the past 24 hours.

### 20 June

Assisted by Claude there is a new generation dashboard that shows a 24 hour rolling stacked graph of operational generation at 5 minute intervals. Available for any region or from the NEM. Data from AEMO's nemweb portal but of course all errors are mine alone. In addition you can also see capacity utilisation by fuel although not by individual power station. I may add that later. At the time of writing there is next to no wind in NSW. That's great for my F5J glider practice but not so much for wind electricity generation. 
As the number of dashboards is growing I now include them all under a reorganised menu. I'm quite proud of the data you can see here. Lots of NEM history, uptothe minute view of prices and operational generation, the global share of generation by fuel and country and other stuff. At the moment the data is not available for download but for casual viewers of what's what you could do worse.

### 13 June

Lots of work on green iron which can be found in the main menu but here's a table with the outlook for generation capacity

And the even more astonishing battery capacity in the NEM:

## 26 May

Noting tha Golden Plains max output is now over 400 MW, whereas MacIntyre has yet to get over 220 MW. Also that in South Australia batteries are starting to show up in a more meaningful way although still nothing like where they will be across the entire NEM in another 18 months.

A couple of charts. The first from one of the most interesting climate science people out there, Zeke Hausfather who has updated a chart showing how well the original 1970 climate science forecasts have turned out. As Zeke points out when the forecasts were prepared they were at odds with history. So quite daring.

### 7 May

The CIS tender contemplates support for 23 GW of renewable energy installed by 2030. So far result for one tender of 6 GW have been announced and results are expected this October for the second 6 GW. The award of CIS contracts, and the announcement of a contract winner is not the same as having said award actually signed as various pre conditions including a transmission agreement have to be satisfied equally does not mean the generation will be built. In fact in some ways its only the first stage.

So in my opinion the number one priority for the  new Federal Govt is to make sure that the generation and transmission is actually built. There are other areas of policy that can be developed but the basic bread and butter is turning contract awards into electricity generating infrastructure.

![](./media/image-20250507212235404.png)

### 1 May

Heading into the Federal election I see the choice between on the one hand an energy policy and direction that has delivered around 40% renewables with a clear industry supported path to 70-80% renewables by 2030. This path is not without issues but they are increasingly well understood and whether its social value, system control, system resilience, or spot price spikes solutions have been identified. On the other hand we have an alternative policy that is untested in Australia, ill suited to what has been built so far and would essentially be a Federal Govt industry. There are clear and obvious risks around timing and cost and Australia's carbon emissions will be way higher. The alternative policy does not, with some exceptions, have industry support. I don't see how there is any real choice but to support the ALP and other politicians of the same renewables mind set whether teals(my preference), greens or others.

### 24 Apr

Gas demand is uncertain, but excluding LNG on the East Coast cost and electrification will reduce demand but the medium term gas generation requirement might go up. Indeed will go up in AEMO's view, but in my view to some extent it depends on the amount of storage built.

Even allowing for the European carbon cost gas still would be cheaper at around \$19/GJ than hydrogen.

### 12 Apr

A couple of charts from smart energy that made me think. First from Keith Lovegrove detailing final energy consumption and noting that heat uses 30% of demand compared to 20% for electricity. ["The Australian Industrial Process Heat Market"](https://itpthermal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/itpproccess-heat-report_final08042025.pdf)



![Final energy decomposed. Source:ITP](./media/image-20250410153255469.png)

That was not unexpected based on previous work but in TIL (things I learned) it was the almost incidental presentation by Todd Hacking CEO of the Heavy Vehicle Association that made the most impact. There is no policy for decarbonising trucks in Australia, zero, even thought they will be about 10% of total emissions by 2030.

### 7 Apr

In my LLM and energy initiation  note back in February I grandiosely talked about refining the PUE metric to allow for the processor output, ultimately amount of computing per unit of input energy to the data centre. Its somewhat please therefore to see Nvidia talking the same way as discussed by [Foundation Capital.](https://foundationcapital.com/nvidias-ai-factory-bet/)

> Jensen argues that the same logic now applies to AI infrastructure. The inputs to these modern factories are electricity and data. The outputs are tokens â€“ the atomic units of prediction, reasoning, and generation that power AI systems. The new unit of productivity is tokens per second per watt: a measure not only of how fast chips are, but of how efficiently intelligence can be produced at scale.



## 6 Apr

Like everything else the cost of gas generation has been rising. For instance [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paulfbrowning_2222kw-x-45-gw-10b-thats-the-price-activity-7313315128383275008-T59D?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAUkHcQBzXAEHsRrOL2lKy5vzMfMR3G3Qbk) on Linkedin shows the USA  Homer City Redevelopment brownfields gas generation capital cost of US\$ 2.2m/MW. And that's brownfields. Translate to Australia at say 1 AUD = 0.65 USD, punch in a gas price of A\$10/GJ  and a capacity factor of 65% and I think your looking at around A\$140/MWh. If you build that on a greenfields site, allow for an Australian cost premium and maybe even higher gas price you could get some big numbers. Certainly way higher than the futures price. I can't see combined cycle gas a goer in Australia for generation investment, not without a big change in plans.

### 1 Apr

I wrote something on gas yesterday  ["Social hour at the gas rodeo"](https://itkservices3.com/posts/gas_policy.html) and in the TL:DR the main points were:

- The cost of gas in gas generation is not really the point. The point is the price that gas generation receives which generally is far above cost and reflects its pricing power, similar to batteries and hydro. 
- There isn't necessarily that much gas in the medium term and
- Santos has a very powerful and dominant position in the Southern Australian gas market. The LNG majors could challenge that position but have zero interest in doing so.

## 27 Mar

How would the electricity price look in a world of just solar and batteries? Imagine a flat load of 100 MW with just enough solar and batteries to meet that load and let's ignore the transmission. The variable cost of solar is zero and LCOE is A\$60/MWh. The batt

I eventually got around to adding up the data for all the countries in the IEA data base and including it in my visualise global energy app. For some reason the IEA and OECD total appear to exclude at least China even though the data is reported. My total includes the total for each country. It clearly shows that coal remains dominant but all the growth is coming from renewables.

I am not even an Economist's bootlace, probably why I wear slip-ons, financial analysis is more my thing. Also note the false zero in this chart from semianalysis but it does make me wonder how likely it is that the USA can base strong economic growth on a recovery in manufacturing even with all the multiplier impacts that manufacturing has.

Finally I've added an iframe embedded menu link  to EnergyInsiders podcast. This means that when you click on the link you go to the SoundCloud page and see a list of EnergyInsiders episodes but remain on the ITK site. Claude assisted with formatting the iframe reference.

### 28 Feb 

The following tables show the new wind, solar and batteries commissioning and under construction. The data is sourced from that great resource www.renewmap.com.au  In percentage growth rows I have made some gross assumptions about how commissioned assets are. For instance Macintyre wind farm max output is about 180/950 MW. It wont output at max capacity so it could be regarded as fully commissioned at say 600 or 700 MW of output.

Overall the numbers show we can still expect about a 33% increase in wind output broadly split between commissioning and under construction, a 58% increase in utility solar output, assuming none of the new assets are curtailed, and that of course will be wrong. On my calculations depending on curtailment I expect the committed construction and commissioning assets to take renewable generation  which also includes rooftop and hydro to take renewable generation to about 50% of demand. The batteries should result in less curtailment of utility solar as well as having an impact on prices.

![Utiity solar in the NEM. Source:www.renewmap.com.au](./media/image-20250228220107236.png)

Batteries under construction seem to be growing 1 GW a month and as previously discussed huge increases are expected.

### 24 Feb

I was asked on Linked in by an anti renewables person to show the electricity price on a figure of mine that shows renewable generation compared to thermal generation. He probably expected the price to go shooting up as renewables penetration has increased. Normally I don't show price on NEM total figures because prices are regional. Still the  following figure shows a region volume weighted moving average price. Phew what mouthful. For each half hour get the region's total production as a share of nem production and multiple the region spot price by that weight. Then get an 8760 half hours moving average.

Total volume includes rooftop volumes which dont of course have spot prices but still represents production. I was quite pleased to show that although volatile, prices are relatively flat (up $6 or about 8%) on six years ago. As Ben and everyone else knows the big price spike was due to coal and gas price increases. Even last year the wind drought caused prices to spike and that's visible in the figure.

One of the less talked about benefits of renewables is that generally the cost is fixed. Not so with coal and gas where fuel prices vary.

For completeness I also show a break down of the price by using the weighted regional prices in an area graph. More colourful but not much additional insight.

The main message is that really spot prices haven't changed that much over time. And over time renewable penetration has increased to close to 50%.

A quick note that all the writing on this site is done in markdown using [Typora](https://typora.io). Word is a great program but converting between Word and the internet is a constant struggle. Most content these days is consumed on a smart device and using "native" tools improves the experience. PDFs and Word documents were designed with the A4 page in mind. HTML text is designed the screen. Writing in Typora is easily translated via Pandoc to HTML. Rather than using Pandoc directly though it's handled on my site with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) which is a static site building program designed by academics primarily for academic publishing. That is journal articles and books. However it turns out to be good at building static sites as well.

Typora costs US\$14 and Quarto is free. Python is free as are all the packages that I use. VSCode, used to write the Python and the various other YAML (configuration files) is also free.

AEMO makes its ISP data available freely.

In short a determined analyst can go a long way with only minimal capital expenditure, but you have to put the time in.

### 6 Feb

The world of electricity tariffs becomes a big deal when I start to think about the ongoing role of DER in Australia. Right now my focus is on what lies beneath Gentailer time of use policy. Extract from something I'm writing.

As far as I can tell when you get an online quote from one of the big gentailers the first thing that happens is that the retailer goes away and instantly retrieves meter information for the entered address. At a minimum that information includes total consumption and whether the address is on a fixed rate or time of use distribution plan. It may, for all I know, include other information.

The retailer will then provide a  set of quotes that assumes the customer wants to stay on the same type of plan eg if you were on a fixed rate the retailer assumes you want to stay on fixed rate and so you will only see fixed rate quotes. If you were on a time of use plan you will only see time of use plans. Unless you are a well informed customer and provided to talk either to the call centre or the chatbot you will never even know that the other type of plan is available.

In early February 2025 a summary of the quotes I received for two premises in the same street in the Ausgrid distribution franchise are in the table below.

### 29 Jan

If you are following the LLM progress and debate, arguably the biggest thing in world productivity since the internet became popular then I thoroughly recommend bookmarking [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net) It will still help if you are used to discussing programming concepts. As well as being a true expert in his own right with Django authorship on his CV, Simon is completely switched into the LLM/Python/AI blogging network and picks the eyes out of what needs to be read.

Regarding climate change I also recommend reading Ben Strauss's [piece](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2e6b) on Sea Level Rise 

> These combined factors yield about 2.3 m of long-term SLR per 1 âˆ˜C global warming, consistent with a wide range of paleo records [[8](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2e6b#erlac2e6bbib8), [14](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2e6b#erlac2e6bbib14), [15](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2e6b#erlac2e6bbib15)], long-term projections from physical models of the components [[16](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2e6b#erlac2e6bbib16)â€“[19](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2e6b#erlac2e6bbib19)] and the newest assessment of the IPCC [[20](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2e6b#erlac2e6bbib20)].

The point here which I tend to forget is that we have 10 CM of sea level rise to date but the 1.5C of locked in warming means that about 3.5 metres of sea level rise is locked in over the next century or so. Of course there will dykes and other defences but there is also going to be misery. Glaciers once melted wont be recreated in a hurry.

Jarrod Bleijie has ["called in](https://reneweconomy.com.au/brookfield-backed-wind-farm-in-limbo-three-others-on-pause-as-lnp-overhauls-state-approval-process/)" a series of large proposed wind farms in QLD. This provides a 40 day period for review of the QLD assessment process of the proposed wind farms. In total 3.9 GW. Yes 3.9 GW of wind development. One of the wind farms is the Wongalee 80% of the output is contracted to RIO for the Boyne Island smelter.

I'll be following this development with interest but I doubt very much if Wongalee will be stopped. Anyone stopping RIO from decarbonising Boyne Island and potentially leading to its closure is unlikely to be a vote winner. Still Bleijie's history suggests he is hard right.

At the risk of seeming an even bigger fool than usual I've tried to delve into the outlook for hyper scale data centres and some cost metrics. It's a great field but as usual many traps for space cadets. Key point is that most of the cost is in the IT equipment and that has a high degree of technological obsolescence. Equally interesting is that the price of processing a token has fallen by, wait for it, 1000% over two years.

Doug Lewin does a great job covering the Texas electricity scene. We had him on the podcast last year. His latest [update](https://www.douglewin.com/p/peak-demand-tomorrow-morning-is-the?utm_source=substack&publication_id=1180283&post_id=154302042&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&utm_campaign=email-share&triggerShare=true&isFreemail=true&r=3nk8yr&triedRedirect=true) notes over 73 GW of demand forecast tomorrow. Doug notes that every time it gets really cold gas production in the Permian Basin falls significantly and this can impact gas supply to speakers. However TX now can produce, even in Winter, over 21 GW of peak solar! And as Doug points out TX resilience has greatly been increased by now having 10 GW of batteries up from 5 GW a year ago and no doubt more on the way.

### 3 January 25

Back in 2000 I wasn't so sure I'd get to 2025 and in some ways I nearly didn't. Now that I'm here I've actually taken out a sub to [semi analysi](https://semianalysis.com)s so I can do a better job of understanding data centre development and energy. It's more than just energy though, development of AI and its infrastructure is just a great analysis topic. Look for more to follow once I get some more reading under the hood.

### 30 Dec

A couple of things to catch the eye from the weekly update of data from NEM Review. 

1. Coal's market share in the last seven days is under 50% across the NEM and the total renewable share at 47%. I don't put too much store by this demand is low over Christmas and solar output is high, but still the trend remains fairly clear. Even in Victoria coal was at just 51%. And if you look at the numbers carefully the potential for wind to pick up share in NSW and QLD is very clear

   ![Supply makeup. Source:NEM Review](./media/image-20241230150312302.png){width=80%}

   2. There are three  large wind farms commissioning at the moment:

      - Golden Plains East  (756 MW) in Victoria;
      - Macintyre Wind Farm (923 MW) in Queensland and;
      - Clark Creek Wind Farm (450 MW ) in Queensland.  

      Total capacity is thus a touch over 2.1 GW. The maximum daily output of each project over the past 21 days is shown below. You can see that Macintyre after hitting 70 MW appears to have shut down for the festive season.

      Although these wind farms won't hit 100% of nominal capacity we never the less can confidently look forward to a significant uplift in wind output in QLD and VIC in 2025 and beyond. Each of these projects has a sister project and in the case of Golden Plains West that is already in construction. 2000 MW with say a 38% average capacity factor represents around 6.5 TWh pretty much the same output as the Vales Point B station in NSW over the past 12 months. Equally if there is no demand growth that should go close to pushing VRE production in Spring and Summer beyond coal. Not for a full year though. That still needs more.

### 29 Dec

English translation of Huadian's (Large IPP in China) [interim](https://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2024/0830/2024083002476.pdf)

For some years I have been interested to compare the price of electricity in China with the LCOE of VRE in Australia. That's because I believe a wind and solar powered aluminium smelter in Australia can be competitive with an unsubsidised smelter in China that uses electricity supplied by one of the big IPPs (independent power producers).

When you think about it China imports coal for Australia, that has to be expensive, same as in Japan.

The evidence for this has always been there. I hadn't looked for a while but here is a paragraph or two from the interim report of Huadian"

> "During the Period, the power generated by the Group amounted to approximately 101.30 million MWh, representing a decrease of approximately 5.85% over the corresponding period in 2023; the on-grid power sold amounted to approximately 94.71 million MWh, representing a decrease of approximately 5.97% over the corresponding period in 2023.
> The average utilisation hours of the generating units were 1,741 hours, representing a year-on-year decrease of 192 hours, among which the average utilisation hours of coal-fired generating units were 1,926 hours, representing a year-on-year decrease of 225 hours, and the coal consumption for power supply was 285.28g/KWh, which was remarkably better than the national average. The on-grid tariff was RMB509.94/MWh, representing a decrease of approximately 3.25% compared with the same period of the previous year. The unit price of standard coal for furnace was RMB970.88/ton, representing a decrease of 11.16% over the corresponding period in 2023."

Note:
1 the less than 50% capacity utilisation of coa generationl;
2 On grid price RMB 510/MWh = AUD \$112/MWh not so cheap;
3 Standard coal (29 GJ/t) price of RMB 971/t = \$AUD$ 214/t = AUD \$7.3/GJ

Firmed renewable energy in Australia can compete with that and its time more people realised it.

Excellent ref to the [social cost of carbon](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05224-9). I doubt if any single study can get close to the real answer, but this is one of the most comprehensive studies ever done.

> Here we show that improved probabilistic socioeconomic projections, climate models, damage functions, and discounting methods that collectively reflect theoretically consistent valuation of risk, substantially increase estimates of the SC-CO2. Our preferred mean SC-CO2 estimate is $185â€‰per tonne ofâ€‰CO2 ($44â€“$413â€‰per tCO2: 5%â€“95% range, 2020 US dollars) at a near-term risk-free discount rate of 2%, a value 3.6â€‰times higher than the US governmentâ€™s current value of $51â€‰per tCO2.

The next 3 figures are some I've been monitoring for many years now. They kind of speak for themselves, as a good figure does.

Although I need to make rooftop a different colour in this one:

And why would you want to stop the trend in the following figure to wait 20 years for some mythical nuclear BS? Although I'll be the first to agree the crocodile jaws closing hasn't made much progress this year. But as the oft quoted Billy S. put it " the course of true love never ere ran smooth"

### 19 Dec

Can't drive just yet so spending some time trying to make this chatter file update without reloading entire site. Making the technology doing something Quarto wasn't really designed to do.

Also spending pleasurable time watching Danny Price on the defensive, trying to justify the house of cards he so carefully built to justify nuclear. In the process amongst many other issues seeing him dismiss the AER cost of carbon as just wrong, like how would he know, state as a fact that AEMOS's ISP coal closure timetable was wrong and in general try to show that what he did was fair and reasonable when in fact it was very far from that.

And seems like I have the netlify serveless function working :-)

**A vote for the LNP is a vote for blackouts.**

Australia has relatively few coal stations now although they still account for about 61% of total NEM wide energy. Every unit that has a forced outage, or even a planned outage represents a material share of supply just now.

If the LNP has their way they will expect to keep this already unreliable system as the backbone of supply for the next 15 to 20 years while nuclear plants are built. The risks for the sake of ideology are basically insance from Australia's best interest. National security, growth in the economy, the well being of the "State" are all threatened by this ideological crusdae. A crusade that is entirely unsupported by the industry on which it will be forced.

Australia cannot afford the risk.

And I hear Danny Price is being his usual difficult self.

Finally for today it was a pleasure to interview Chris Bowen for the last episode of EnergyInsiders, and a good interview it is, in my opinion. The audience was down a touch this year to 700k so we have a way to go catch "the rest is history" and yet I felt well on top of the subject. Priorities next year will be a little more international interviews, and a little more climate change.

### 17 Dec
Changes to the front page look, hopefully for the better. Actually took all day fiddling with various Quarto options and demonstrating my lack of skill at this task but now part 1 done.

### 16 Dec

Back from hospital.  I had excellent surgeon and I believe anaesthetist  but I still dont recommend a major mitral valve repair, 7 hours on the table emerging like a pin cushion with garden hoses popping out the tummy etc until its necessary. Mine was and glad to get it done.



As a result haven't caught up on the electricity data fully for a couple of weeks and there are a couple of temporary data issues. I update my data for key charts and tables only once a week and the latests is available from the "NEM-dash" menu item. Nevertheless spot prices are clearly way higher this year than last running over \$200/Mwh in NSW. 

![flat load prices, data source: NEM Review](./media/image-20241216125739977.png){.lightbox} 

The reason for high prices is obvious. Coal generation is down and besides rooftop its gas and hydro that have had to make up most of the difference.

Overall wind conditions have not been all that special and its quite normal to have a wind down turn at this time. 

![VRE Data source: NEM Review](./media/image-20241216130236277.png){.lightbox} 

Of the three big wind farms Macintyre (1000 MW) hit max output of 70 MW, Golden Plains hasn't done much over 50 and Clarke Creek is still in very early days (4 MW)

### 5 December

At Carl Daley at [Wattclarity](https://wattclarity.com.au/articles/2024/12/wrap-up-of-price-spikes-in-november-2024/)  points out that the last week of November is often when price spikes occur. The only explanation I can think of is that November is when coal generators do maintenance and weather is a bitt hotter than in the main part of  Spring so demand can be relatively elevated. Demand in NSW never got with in  10% of its all time record but there were certainly price spikes. The following figure, done in a hurry as I am off to Hospital in an hour for a long standing valve leak repair, shows NSW 5 minute prices for most of this year(or as long as I've been downloading the data.) 

Until there are more batteries online I expect to see these 5 minute price spikes continue. They certainly push up average prices.

### 29 Nov

The new [CEC  Board](https://cleanenergycouncil.org.au/about-us) is  a bunch of industry heavyweights  including CEOs of Squadron, Iberdrola Australia and Acciona Renewables head Australia.

Despite its work on standards and despite its leading conference I have long felt that the CEC  has been losing ground to Smart Energy as the main tempo of the industry. Smart Energy takes stronger positions and is generally more aggressive in its marketing. Attendance at its exhibition/conference is free which is in contrast to the CEFC summit. All Energy equally remains free to visitors.

There are therefore at least three organisations committed in part to lobbying and developing policy, the CEC, Smart Energy and the Clean Energy Investor Group(CEIG). There now seems to be considerable overlap between the CEC and CEIG.

Given that CEC  Board positions were heavily contested this year I expect to see some change in the CEC focus and activity over time. 

To me it looks like the CEC is increasingly going to be the big end of the industry and Smart Energy is going to be the organisation for everyone else. That's already been the case I guess for a while but looks to be even more so.

Please to report my latest monthly electricity and petrol bill zero, in fact my retailer stated they owe me $29 which will be applied to the next bill. Despite the cost I expect that attachment rates of batteries to new solar systems is increasing.

Disappointingly even though utility and car battery prices are clearly coming down and in some cases coming down quickly residential batteries have basically been flat for 6 years.  At least according to comparison site [Solar Choice](https://www.solarchoice.net.au/solar-batteries/price/):

Going forward articles will include a comments section. No login is required at this stage as the traffic volume is expected to be low. Comments are generally welcome. I get some email feedback on my articles, the vast majority of which is quite value adding. It seems to me that in many cases that feedback would often do more good being in a comment for others to read.

### 23 Aug

ITK's price forecasts are coming soonish.

### 7 Aug

Updating some previous numbers the going rate for a 6 MW wind turbine seems about $60k per year. So the 54 turbines of  Doughboy windfarm  that 9 landowners turned down is about \$3.2 m or \$97 m over 30 years. Lots of money to give up for any reason. Things must be good in the bush although my understanding 6/9 potential hosts weren't even residents.

### 19 July

Whitehaven reported coal production costs of A$114/t. Price received for NSW thermal coal of US\$137/t (A\$210/t). That's likely for top quality thermal coal (26 gj/t)  but even so translating that back to NSW coal generation for say Eraring gives 9.5 GJ/MWh * 210 / 26 = \$76/MWh fuel cost.

Am emerging leading light in understanding social cohesion and division in the transition is Associate Professor Rebecca Colvin. 

"So, for instance, quite a bit of research has shown that Australia is the second most polarised country on climate change along left-right political lines, with the US being the most polarised country."

A topical quote considering todays headlines that the LNP is more or less turning its back on Paris commitments.

A reminder tha there  are 20 GW of wind and solar operating

![](./media/image-20240605172559432.png)

And the total is set to grow 30% based on projects under construction, although Rye Park 400 MW wind could now be regarded as operating reducing the growth rate.

## CIS scheme webinar

- Not a lot of real news but well attended plenty of Q&A. In response to my question about will it get new capacity built there seems to be a general focus rather than specific provisions. Ie choosing projects that are capable and will be built. Comes down to who is doing the administering. 
- Focus on getting the right number of bidders as the assement process will take months, and too many will slow it down.
