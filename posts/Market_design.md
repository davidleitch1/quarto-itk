# Exploring the impact of VRE on Market Design

In the context of the Nelson review of the NEM design it's useful to consider why a review is needed, to identify the problems and perhaps to forecast what the review may see as the way forward. At the outset it's as well to note that in fact the review is not a full review. The terms of reference are:

> In November 2024, the Australian Government announced a review of the National Electricity Market (NEM) wholesale market settings by an independent expert panel supported by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.
>
> The purpose of the review is to recommend wholesale market settings to promote investment in firmed, renewable generation and storage capacity in the NEM following the conclusion of Capacity Investment Scheme tenders in 2027.

The second point to note is that the review may not survive the forthcoming Federal election and may be supplanted by a quite different review.





The historic arguments in regard to capacity v energy markets have been well debated.

Nuances in the energy market such as a day ahead market were supposed to be formally considered following the Finkel Report but I doubt they really have. Implicitly the view must be that that in the NEM at the time the non decision was made the benefits didn't outweigh the costs.

The main advantage of a day ahead market is it provides a signal to generation that is relatively slow to start up or shut down. That can include combined cycle gas generators, and even some open cycle gas, and of course coal units that may be in warm start phase.
