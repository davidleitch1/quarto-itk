# Like big emitters? AGL's your company

AGL is a company which at present offers investors next to nothing unless you want Australia's biggest emitter invested in an asset declining in value more than 10% per year (LYA & Bayswater have only ten years of life)

AGL has next to no announced plans to replace the more than 30 TWh it gets from its coal fired generation. It has a first right of refusal over Tilt's Liverpool Range station and also will likely fund the Pottinger wind farm in the Riverina.
