# Its easier to see the problems than the answers

As we journey along the winding transition road the focus changes constantly from the problems to the solutions and back again.

##  About the ISP

Recently I read a  comment on LinkedIn

> The ISP is not a forecast. 
>
> The ISP is not prediction that all of the current emissions and RE targets are going to be met.
>
> The ISP is a mathematical solution to the question “what would have to have happened for all of the emissions and RE targets to have been met?”

## Keeping the lights on

Recently the respected Grattan Institute released a report [Keeping the Lights on](https://grattan.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Keeping-the-lights-on-Grattan-Institute-Report.pdf) The report started with the premise:

> But there is mounting evidence that the National Electricity Market (the NEM) may not be able to deliver enough investment in low-emissions generation, storage, and transmission, when and where it will be needed.
>
> Ministers have lost faith in the market’s capacity to do this, consumers are unhappy with high power prices, and industry players are increasingly wary about investing because they have been buffeted by frequent and unpredictable government interventions in the market.

The report's recommendations are uncontroversial in a sense. For example

> Use direct mechanisms with coal generators to provide insurance against early or delayed closure that creates major risks of blackouts and price spikes, or uncertainty for renewables investors. These mechanisms should maintain momentum on emissions reductions and avoid shifting excessive risks from operators to governments and consumers, while being clear and transparent to the market.

The report recommends handing more control to AEMO via a greater role for the ISP. The Energy and Climate Change Ministerial Council (COAG was so much easier) should "Monitor key risks". Personally I rather think they already do that, they should damage the (unspecified) parts of the NEM that work well and there should be periodic reviews.

Post coal, the report recommends designing a new market structure that

> help ensure adequate energy resources in a high-renewables system.

One could interpret this as a call for a capacity mechanism but it isn't spelled out. 

The report then goes through the usual  list of generally very well understood  issues like transmission, risk of premature coal closures, social license and integrating behind the meter. In attempting to look forward the report is at risk of actually looking back. Recent progress on transmission, the role of batteries, the ability to manage frequency via grid forming inverters are kind of downplayed or subsumed within a nod to the "muddle through " approach. In any event other than a more general and transparent management of coal closures, its a carry on recommendation.

In regard to coal closures transparency would be great, but it doesn't seem to be coming. More importantluy what's really left to be done? In NSW its  Bayswater, Vales Point B and Mt Piper and in Victoria LYB that don't yet have, to my knowledge, formal Govt support (DCE = Dont close early handout). More fool them. Origin and CLP and AGL have shown that the best approach is to announce closure. Do that and you get a DCE.

In QLD the State owns most, but not all coal generation. Unfortunately for the owners of Millmerran the Station was opened as recently as 2002 and therefore will struggle to get a "dont close early" handout.
