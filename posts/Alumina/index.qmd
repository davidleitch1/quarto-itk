# The main benefit of decarbonising alumina is cheaper energy, the decarbonisation benefit is secondary

Most of the excellent research that has looked at Australia's alumina
sector has focussed on the potential reduction in carbon emissions.
However as an electricity analyst what I see is an absolutely massive
demand response/battery. ***Alumina* refineries in QLD can potentially
provide the same amount of storage/demand response as a 2 GW/8 hour
battery**. To see how this can be the case, at least from within the
reality distortion bubble of this note read on.

A reminder of the aluminium production process

The aim in this note is to show the economic potential of the alumina
refinery to firm renewable energy provided to an aluminum smelter at
pretty much a break even price. Or at least its a break even in my
reality distortion bubble. Decarbonisation is a side benefit. So is
freeing up 46 PJ of annual gas consumption to remain in the ground.

# Aluminum is 10% of NEM electricity consumption

Aluminum is still about the largest single consumer of electricity in
Australia. Its responsible for 10% roughly of consumption in each of
NSW, QLD and Victoria and probably more in Tasmania.

For some years many of us having been thinking about how to replace coal
fuelled electricity with renewable electricity for aluminum smelting.
However the difficulty (thanks Matt Howell ) is that aluminum smelting
is basically a non interruptible process. Although you can cut power to
a smelter for a couple of hours every now and then, doing so impacts the
"pot" life and its really not what the process wants to do. So aluminum
production is much better suited to something like hydro than to wind
and solar. So in the absence of any intervention you would basically
expect global production of aluminum to shift from coal intensive areas
like China to hydro intensive areas like Russia and Canada as
decarbonisation becomes a bigger and bigger deal.

This means that Australian smelters are at risk of closing. They face
environmental costs which their Chinese competitors do not and they are
not as easy to repower as it might seem. Even though smelter owners are
notorious for wanting government handouts the basic reality is that they
sell the product in a global market and it has to be one way or another
globally competitive. This can be on cost where electricity is normally
the sole differentiator of costs or it could be on value if there was
say a "green" premium. But basically its cost.

Even though Australian wind and solar costs are likely very competitive
with hydro it's the firming component that's difficult. So what looked
like the obvious way to go about things was maybe not so obvious.
Recently though I've been thinking a lot about the intermediate step in
the aluminum process and that's alumina.

# Australia currently produces 14% of the world's alumina

Australia has the largest, but not necessarily most economic, reserves
of bauxite and Australia is a significant global producer for alumina.
However, at least in Queenland the alumina refineries are old.

# Alumina is behind only LNG and power generation as a gas consumer in Australia

The next thing to appreciate is that alumina is the largest single
consumer of gas in Australia outside of electricity generation and LNG
production with total consumption in excess of 220 PJ. The overall flow
of gas in Australia is shown below and I tip my hat to an excellent
Sankey diagram:

change

Eliminating gas in alumina would have a bigger impact than eliminating
gas from all residential consumption let alone new consumption.

# Alumina refineries are well suited to solar power, they can offer very large scale demand response.

**The most important point to understand in this note is that alumina
refineries and particular the digestors are flexible.** Like a pot on
the stove they can be turned up and down with no damage other than a
loss of production. This potentially makes them incredibly useful when
coupled with solar energy. It also may be possible, ah say MAY be
possible, to store excess process heat from the digestor and release it
over night.

So the ultimate idea is to run the flexible alumina refinery and the
aluminum smelter next door on solar and wind energy. The refinery is run
mainly on solar during the day with the excess heat stored. Over night
the refinery cuts its wind solar input right down and supplements it
with stored heat. The wind that the refinery consumes during the day
then becomes available to the inflexible aluminium smelter next door to
replace essentially lost solar production.

In addition any time the wind and solar input has a drought it's the
flexible refinery that takes the hit and the smelter largely keeps on
going.

External firming may still be required but much less often freeing up
the firming capacity, eg Borumba, for other uses. Indeed for those rare
occasions where State wide there is such a drought that the refinery and
Borumba cant handle it then backup generation (eg gas) is called into
action.

## The alumina production process

council

The digestor consumes about 2/3 of the energy used in an alumina
refinery and about 1/3 is used in the calciner. To cut a long story
short to decarbonise the calciner most likely requires hydrogen. I
ignore the more expensive problem of decarbonsing the calcining leg of
alumina manufacturing..

The digestor which is basically a steam kettle can, if you were building
a new refinery, "easily" be made to run on electricity and at relatively
high efficiency. In the most basic view you just replace the gas heat
with resistive heating.

# Focus on QLD as no aluminum in WA

Using alumina refineries as demand response/batteries doesn't require a
coupled aluminum smelter but if they are coupled as in Gladstone it fits
in very nicely with the coordinated industrial region approach that is
increasingly regarded as the lowest cost and most efficient way to
approach industrial decarbonisation see [Climate works
report](https://energytransitionsinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Setting-up-industrial-regions-for-net-zero-Australian-Industry-ETI-report-JUNE-2022.pdf).
Indeed the use of alumina refineries as storage/demand response is
exactly the sort of thing that emerges from a broader look.

A quick estimate is that the digestors use around 12-13 TWh of energy in
QLd

ARENA report

So the alumina refineries in QLD use more energy even in the boilers,
and before considering "double digestors" than the aluminum smelter.

So the combined QLD position is a requirement for about 22 TWh of
renewable energy of which 60% is flexible demand:

However since the idea in this note is to store digestor heat from solar
energy we need more solar and more GW.

The first thing to note is that QLD total operational consumption was
about 54 TWh last year so adding in the alumina refinery adds about 25%
to consumption. Equally it frees up gas for other uses but that is of no
concern to this note. 13 TWh is broadly equivalent to 1.4 GW of flat
load and if we consider it to be a battery its about 70% the proposed
size of the power that Borumba can provide. I won't bore anyone with
social license issues but unless I am even more clueless than I think I
am then providing a clear future for the refineries is likely to be a
social license winner.

What it would require is 12 rather than 8 GW of wind and solar, the more
solar the more GW. But in fact its more than that, because enough power
has to be produced in the middle of the day to fill the refinery storage
for overnight operation. I compiled the portfolio to ensure that on
average there was enough renewable average to cover demand for every
half hour of the average day.

Figure 8 VRE portfolio to run Gladstone

# It really works (in the spreadsheet)

The smelter load is 960 MW and the underlying alumina digestor load is
1800 MW. The digestor is run in two modes, peak and offpeak. Peak is
when its sunny. During this mode the digestor uses excess daytime solar
to charge its storage. This storage is assumed to be "cheap" storage of
process heat. In this case the stored heat is just used to partly run
the digestor at night. This is more than twice as efficient as using the
stored heat to run a turbine that makes electricity. In this system the
energy losses are very low. In the turbine case more than half the heat
is wasted.

The digestor was modelled to run using an input power of 900 MW in non
solar hours supplemented by storage. Again this is a guess. The process
heat storage was enough to provide the missing 900 MW during non solar
hours. In this model about 15 GWh of process heat storage is required
(providing about 900 MW for roughly 16 hours a day) . To charge the
storage and also run the refinery and smelter during the day required
4.5 GW of input power. However only 1800 MW of input power is required
over night.

The most important point is that the smelter itself only needs 960 MW.
Since the system has been sized to provide at least 1800 MW on average
over night, it takes a severe wind drought for the smelter to need
outside power.

The following chart shows how it works on average day over 508,000
modelled half hours using adjusted AEMO provided wind and solar REZ
traces for the period 2024-2050.

average day. Source: ITK

This graph is of course just an average. If wind and solar output falls
away then initially the burden falls on the refinery and some refinery
output is lost. But the refinery can easily cope. **Our main concern is
keeping the power up to the smelter**.

It turns out that for this model there are about 4200 half hours out of
508,000 modelled, that is less than 1% of the time, where there is not
enough wind and solar to run the smelter. The following figure shows the
distribution of those half hours by the shortfall.

Figure 10 Need for aluminum smelter firming. Source: ITK

You can see that for 500 hours (0.1%) of the time 300-500 MW of external
firming is required. A gas generator or a battery could do that easily.
It's a trivial problem.

# Problems - what problems?

If it was this easy it would have been done already.

## Its not that easy to get 12 GW of wind and solar capacity

Looking at the physical problems the first question is how easy is it in
reality to get 12 GW of wind and solar destined for Gladstone? Right now
we can't get any new wind in NSW and even in "can do" QLD things are not
really running all that hot just yet.

## Process heat storage -- what it is and how expensive

Solar thermal electricity has had a bad wrap recently. Its expensive and
some plants have had operational issues. The biggest negative on such
systems is the energy inefficiency. That's because the stored heat has
to be convereted to electricity by running it through a conventional
turbine, often at quite low heat. However in this case the heat is
reused as heat.

In Europe at low temperatures water can store lots of heat and can be
used in "district" heating. At higher temperatures molten salt is
typically used but there are some corrosion issues.

It comes down to material costs, material life, the volume of material
required to store the heat, and how long the heat can be stored. For
alumina digestors it's a relatively simple problem. The heat doesn't
have to be stored for very long because it's a daily cycle, and nor is
there any transport of it required.

For most of the thermal storage technologies the cost of the storage
medium is extremely cheap, but the balance of costs need to be managed.
For example, storing heat in very high temperature water can store a lot
of energy in a very cheap medium, but the pressure tank required would
be enormously expensive. The view is that for something like Alumina
refineries, refactory bricks and molten salts are the leading
technologies. Some general comments are: 

**Molten salt** -- Proven. Pressure issues if you let it freeze (don't
do that). Corrosion issues and hard to pump. Nitrate salts are only in
Chile and there are price shocks in concert with fertilizer.

**Refractory brick** -- Proven. Still very cheap, but not as cheap as
rocks or water. The "tank" is very cheap, just an insulated box. Scales
really well -- uses the three most abundant elements on Earth. No
pressure/creep/degradation. No oxidation. 

No special fluids or equipment. Charges fast during offpeak, but not as
good on discharge, good enough to deliver baseload heat plus a bit of
flex.

**Sand/rocks** -- Very cheap/abundant medium. Thermal expansion creates
pressure on the tank, eventually the medium crushes into dust. Needs
stronger blower to get heat in/out which increases auxiliary losses.

**Molten metal** -- good heat capacity \[not actually valuable in
stationary applications\]. Oxidises in hot air -- needs special barrier
or fluid. Unproven material science for a long-lived asset.

**Graphite** -- very conductive so easy to get heat in/out. Not cheap,
but not prohibitive. Supply competition with lithium batteries. Catches
fire in hot air -- needs special fluid blanket.

**Concrete** -- usually bad with heat, no particular advantages

If I pulled a number out of thin air of A\$100/KWh capital cost, then 15
GWh costs \$1500 million, just as an example.

The real point is if you want to run the smelter on renewable energy it
needs 24 x 7 firmed power. Considering the smelter alone, the MW
involved, that's likely to be expensive. Using the flexible refineries
produces a lot of value.

## Spot energy

Despite the flexibility of the system there will be many occasions where
generation is way too high for the alumina/aluminum system to handle.
That's because I've sized the system to ensure that on average there is
enough power available.

The overall portfolio outputs are summarised below. On average there is
0.8 GW of spot energy available with a max of 6.3 GW. That is not a bad
thing . It can be used for many other purposes including contributing
significantly to QLD electricity supply or running say hydrogen fuelled
calcining.

Figure 11 VRE portfolio summary. Source: ITK

Shortfall in the figure above is when VRE output is not enough to run
the smelter and refinery at full capacity.It is assumed to result in
lost alumina production at a rate of 1 tonne per 2 MWh

If we look at the daily distribution of the spot excess using the median
rather than the average, so avoiding extremes there is still typically
up to 2.5 GW surplus as the sun rises and as it sets because that is
when the solar output is most volatile. At other times there is about
500-600 MW surplus to run overnight demand elsewhere. Notionally that
surplus is relatively high value.

height="2.75in"}

Figure 12 Portfolio surplus output.

## Lost alumina production is about 10% of output.

Wind and solar input will rarely exactly equal demand. In most half
hours there will be excess or shortfall. As discussed the excess can be
sold on the market and in this model the shortfall is valued as lost
production, roughly 700kt or 10% of annual output.

## Site specific considerations

I have no real idea of how practical this system is. I don't have any
idea what the cost of a competitive alumina refinery is. I don't really
know whether there is enough space for the thermal storage imagined in
this model. I have no concept of transmission issues.

The biggest unknown for me in regard to economics is the cost and
performance of thermal storage.

# Imaginary economics

In this section I make up some price assumptions and fiddle with the
numbers until I get the result I want. Uh hang on that's what I used to
do in the research dept. This is the real deal. Just kidding. In fact
you can make up any numbers you want for the input prices. These numbers
are overnight costs ignoring transmission. The "green" price is assumed
to be a constant. Somehow you can purchase wind and solar for \$60/MWh
and get an REC with a value of \$30 thrown in. Then you can turn around
and sell the surplus output for \$50/MWh but without the certificate.

On the other hand who knows what coal generation will cost in QLD going
forward. Its kind of a moot point because its all supposed to go away.

However the biggest point maybe that you only need a normal as opposed
to do gooder, super greenie level of optimism to make the numbers seem
possible.

I suspect that there are a few lines missing in these sums but no doubt
the many eagle eyed readers will be quickly alert me to the many errors.

# Using QLD and NSW wind together with QLD solar

In ITK's opinion any large QLD renewable project that doesn't take
advantage of the portfolio benefit of including some NSW wind is nuts.

The following figure shows the correlation of wind output between the
various Queensland and NSW REZs. Basically the deeper the brown colour
the less correlated the two zones are and therefore the lower
variability of a wind portfolio that combines them. Some zones actually
are negatively correlated. Negative correlation is wonderful if you can
get. It means that when one zone isn't blowing the other one is likely
to be blowing. Careful perusal of the "map" will show that combining Q3
and Q4 wind with N7 and N8 wind would be a good idea. It might be that
in reality that can only be done financially.

The map below shows the zone locations. Plausible portfolios that don't
require too much transmission imagination might be N1 through N3 with
say Q3- through Q7. Q8 and Q9 are too close to the northern NSW zones
including Orana and don't give the same portfolio benefit.

Equally large scale solar can be built faster and possibly has a lower
cost of energy than wind. Notionally such a large project could also
manage the risk with access the spot market given the predictable
surplus of midday power coming from behind the meter. That is you might
undersize your contracted portfolio. That too is ignored here.

For most renewable systems in Australia, the general finding is that the
ideal mix is about 70% wind and 30% solar. Because of the large solar
resource in QLD and because we are viewing the refinery(s) as a pseudo
battery lets push up the solar ratio to 50% with say 35% of power coming
from QLD wind and 15% from NSW wind. I don't worry about the solar side
of things except to note that spreading the solar out within QLD will
likely improve results.

These numbers are just guesss.

All real world issues like transmission are completely ignored.
