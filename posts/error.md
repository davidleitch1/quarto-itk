### Yesterday's note was a draft sent in error

My apologies for sending out a very far from finished note. I run my own publishing system, write the notes, do the modelling and have a tendency to make careless mistakes. That's why my brother is the cardiologist and I am the analyst. Well he's smarter as well.

ITK is working very hard on our price forecasting model and making by our standards a very significant  investment. A note about DWA pricing  and the role of Govt will be released when the work is finished.

Again my apologies for releasing a draft of a note likely to take weeks to finish.
