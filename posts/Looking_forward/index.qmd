# Transmission, supply chain, GPS are not issues. Willingness is the issue

Price signals are unambiguously positive at least in NSW and QLD and
even a renewable developer can work out prices in Victoria will rise
post the Yallourn closure.

Yet over the past year we've all had to stand around and hear a long
list of complaints from wind and solar developers. No transmission,
supply chain, costs, GPS, uncertainty (God forbid returns are not
guaranteed).

The only thing anyone talks about is batteries even though batteries are
net consumers of energy.

The groups that have most disappointed me are the big renewable
developers Iberadrola, CWP (or whatever its called these days), Tilt and
their ilk. These guys don't have the legitimacy of running coal
generators to maximise end of life cash flows, they have large balance
sheets and are completely capable of taking on some risk should they
choose to do so.

Then of course there are the Gentailers. At least their lack of
commitment is normal. I laugh to see 70% of shareholders that voted in
favour of the ORG scheme but now have to put up with a company that
remains neither fish nor fowl and where uncertainty remains the day.
Aussie Super "we'll save ya" attitude and why don't you buy some Santos
or Woodside comes really as no surprise. For sure they are big and
proved size does matter. Poor old EnergyAustralia must wonder how
Brookfield can talk to AGL and Origin but EA and its owner CLP are left
as wall flowers, continuously passed over, despite showing all the leg
they can get away with.

As usual, and I speak as someone who passionately believes in markets,
its Government, and in this case the QLD Govt that has stepped into the
breach.

Nevertheless the point of this note is to observe that:

-   Transmission will be available in NSW from 2026 and plenty by 2028.
    It takes that long to build new wind farms so these guys should be
    committing now.

-   Supply chain issues, at least in terms of wind turbines, are not an
    issue. If you order a turbine from Vestas you can get it at the same
    euro price as last year. You can possibly get a Goldwind turbine for
    less than last year.

-   Price signals remain strong and there is even more financial
    support.

-   AEMO is, from what I can see, increasingly [ready to rock and
    roll](https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/electricity/nem/network_connections/connections-scorecard/connections-scorecard---october-2023.pdf?la=en).

I guess its still legitimate to say that Humelink is not certain and the
Orana contract has not actually been announced, but as Irving Fisher so
poetically observed in the preface to "Theory of Interest", "coming
events cast their shadows before". If I can see the transmission is
coming with my fading eyesight it must be crystal clear to renewable
developers.

# Two big events left this year

Results from AEMO services tender 2 for renewable energy in NSW are
expected to be released in the next couple of weeks. That should cover
around 1 GW of projects, a drop in the ocean but still very welcome
news. Hopefully at least some new wind.

Energyco (AEMO Services partner in NSW) will also release a year end
update Monday 11 December. It would not surprise me to find that the
Orana transmission contract is also announced then.

Then, of course, the first draft of the 2024 ISP will also be released
in the next couple of weeks. Although ostensibly a transmission planning
exercise, the reality is that the 2022 ISP was the document that
convinced stakeholders that we all in reality expected a decarbonised
NEM and sooner rather than later. Not so much price discovery as belief
discovery.

In any event the ISP 2024 will embody State Govt policies such as
Victoria's offshore wind target, misguided as it may be, the Queensland
plan, misguided though Borumba may be and changes to the NSW outlook
including delays to Snowy 2. Personally I could not give a rats about
the delay to Snowy 2 or its cost. For me the world has moved on. Still
lets leave ISP 2024 until its released. Speculation is pointless.

# Transmission outlook is improving

For years commentators have focussed on transmission as the key enabler
of a strong renewable electricity system. The earliest article I wrote
about this here at Reneweconomy was on July 5 2017 [\"Transmission we
need to start building
now\"](https://reneweconomy.com.au/transmission-we-need-to-start-building-now-to-deal-with-wind-and-solar-boom-13411/).
That was only a year after I left UBS. At that time the then AEMC Chair
John Peirce oversaw a rigid approach embodied in the logical and
seemingly rational but ultimately utterly misguided view of new
transmission embedded in the RIT-T test.

It was clear even then, using the best practice Texas example, it would
take seven years to build new transmission, just as it was clear even
then that the existing transmission network in the NEM would likely be
in the wrong place for wind and solar. However at that time it wasn't
clear just how congested the existing network actually was.

Despite the blackout in South Australia by 2023 the only new
transmission actually being built other than some minor augmentations in
the QLD-NSW link is the SA-NSW link and that not due for completion
until 2026. Indeed building new transmission has taken every bit as long
as feared back in 2017.

During this period, stoked by rabble rousers, fear and doubt (FUD) about
the ability of Australia to build something as simple as some wires and
poles has grown and grown. Transmission and wind farms are now portrayed
as ruining the Australian way of life, a source of endless depression
and creating environmental destruction.

My view of reality is that renewable energy and the associated
transmission will preserve the Australian way of life, bring more
prosperity to regional Australia, is the best thing that can be done to
preserve the environment and will lead to lower and more certain
electricity prices. Color me a hippy.

Today a wide range of "experts" and advisors contend that the lack of
access to transmission is the No 1 problem preventing new renewable
energy projects from starting.

Personally I not fully convinced that transmission is necessarily
holding back projects right now. I think wind and solar developers lack
a willingness to commit, perhaps hoping to move the dial in their
favour. For instance the 400 MW Uunguala wind farm in Northern NSW could
have started construction 12 months ago but Twiggy Forrest seems too
busy posturing on the world stage to sign the contract.

# \$40 bn of transmission under development \$12 bn ready by 2028

There is over \$40 bn of transmission under development.

But if I focus on NSW as the State with the highest forward prices and
the largest consumer of electricity and look at when significant new
transmission will be available I see:

# Humelink, Orana will make a difference in NSW

In my opinion Humelink is roughly on target to be built by December
2026. That's despite ongoing opposition to building it above ground,
despite not all easements agreed, despite a recent 22 km route length
increase, despite not one but two upper house enquiries and despite the
fact it has yet to get final approval from the AER or a final investment
decision.

My confidence comes from the up to \$600 m of pre commitment spending
that has already and will continue to take place ahead of the AER
decision next year and because the above ground line is lower cost and
faster to build than competing underground proposals.

Secondly My guess is that the independent consortium developing the
Orana REZ transmission link will be able to confirm that link in the
near future. Confirmation of that should enable the pricing to be
available to projects in that general area such as Liverpool Ranges Wind
farm and Valley of the Winds wind farm.

Between those two projects alone and with the 800 MW capacity of Project
Interconnect now well underway NSW will have removed one of the many
excuses developers from Origin Energy to Tilt provide as to why they
aren't building projects.

## Humelink could enable the South West of NSW to leap ahead of the North

Few transmission lines can have been discussed as much as Humelink.
Although some folk see it for better or worse as being built to
facilitate Snowy 2, in my mind that is largely irrelevant. Basically I
see Humelink as doing two main jobs. Firstly its basically the second
half of the South Australia -- NSW link (Project Energyconnect).
Secondly it facilitates the increasingly attractive South West REZ. Why
is the Southwest REZ attractive? Well basically there are less people
than in the North of State. One wind farm I looked at has only 32
affected residents. No people, no problem.

There are various large wind and solar farms planned for say the East of
Balranald area that will have difficulty getting energy to NSW load
without more capacity between Wagga and Sydney.

EG the Yanco Delta project 10 km north-west of Jerilderie (where I fly
model planes every year and where Ned Kelly gave the bankers an early
scare) is a 1.5 GW wind project, quite well progressed in its EIS that
hopes to connect to Dinawan substation. Dinawin is as substation built
as a result of Project Energyconnect just to the West of Wagga. Equally
Spark Energy's "Dinawin Wind Farm" is another 1500 MW project at the
scoping report stage. Dinawin is also where VNI West is scheduled to
connect

The 750 MW Burrawong Wind Farm is close to Balranald, is a Windlab
project at the SEARs stage.

The scoping report for Engie's proposed 1800 MW "Plains Windfarm" near
Hay has a map showing these developments. Engie is doing the job the NSW
Department of Planning seems incapable of in providing a regional map.

Already the Wagga to Sydney transmission is so congested during the day
that electricity flows almost every day but particularly in high solar
days from higher priced NSW to lower or negatively priced Victoria (see
[Whats happening round
Wagga](https://wattclarity.com.au/articles/2023/11/whats-happening-around-wagga/))

Basically this entire precinct needs Humelink or something like it.
