# Transmission, social license and easements

This note started out as a narrow piece on landholder access value.
However its grown to comment on the value of transmission, the relative
value of individual projects and the in my opinion, improper use of
inherently inaccurate RIT NPV models to drive decisions instead of using
them to facilitate decisions and improve understanding.

The ISP is at its heart more than a transmission planning tool, it is a
synthesis of policies adopted by Australian Goverments, Federal (zero
added value) and State to show how those policies can be brought
together to decarbonise the NEM and hold electricity prices steady. Even
so although the ISP recognises the need for social license, it isn't
modelled. Nor does it explicitly model electricity prices and therefore
competition impacts that an integrated NEM provides. Nevertheless it
rises above being "just an NPV model" because of the vision it presents.
And because of the seemingly simply but actually highly democratic
"Delphi" process its clear its been able to sell that vision to a
majority of stakeholders. The sale of that vision is the "capstone" of
the social license required and the consequences.

If we are going to reconfigure the NEM some transmission will need to be
built. Arguments over the merits or demerits of individual transmission
projects cannot escape this central point. Some old transmission may
lose value. The key evidence today that more transmission between NSW
and Victoria is needed is a forecast \$40-\$50/MWh price difference out
to June 2025 at least.

ITK doesn't expect that difference to be alleviated until project
EnergyConnect \[PEC\] is completed or until there is more supply from
within NSW. As I understand it other than the Waratah battery there is
no prospect of alleviating the Vic to NSW bottleneck until VNI West is
built around 2030 or just after.

Indeed as modelled in the draft 2020 ISP, Vic-NSW alleviation is seen as
relatively low benefit compared to other actionable projects. From a
current price and conditions perspective its tempting to argue that VNI
West is actually the most important project, but that is probably a
short term view.

# And so to social license

Social license starts at the top, at Government selling the plan but the
social costs are paid by the communities and environments that are
impacted.

There is good evidence that even today far too much bargaining power for
transmission lies with the transmission provider and not enough with the
impacted community as compared to fully negotiated bargains between land
owners and wind and solar providers. All consumers benefit from
transmission in the form of lower electricity prices, and greater
security and it's the value of the land in its highest value use as
enabling transmission that should be compared with the visual and other
costs of facilitating transmission to the selling land owner. Equally
the reduction of the value of surrounding land also needs to be factored
in.

And in the case of energy there is a strong case that for historic
reasons land owners in different projects are treated unequally.

In ITK's estimates, the value of "land access" paid to Humelink land
owners or ex owners will be about 1/6 of those paid to windfarm land
owners.

For Humelink the current estimated easement costs are 2.75% of the total
project cost, but will likely rise when the easements are actually
negotiated. My point here is that easement costs are not a major
decision driver. Still up to a point social license is, but only to a
transmission developer, only up to a point.

## Minera accessl, above ground access and infrastructure land access all operate under separate regimes

Mineral resources beneath the ground, such as coal and gas are owned by
the Crown, and legally land owners cannot stop access to those with
mining or minerals exploration licenses. In complete contrast wind and
solar resources above the ground belong to the land owner and access is
negotiated by parties with equal bargaining power. Finally transmission
and distribution of energy and in general social infrastructure access
is governed by easements. Easements pay the landowner the value of the
land in its current use, but not for the marginal value, generally a lot
higher in its alternative use as an electricity or water pipe right of
way

Historically transmission developers have paid little or no attention to
social license That's because historically all transmission developers
have been concerned with is getting their project through the RIT test,
as silly as that test is, and past the Australian Energy Regulator
\[AER\]. And history shows that's been difficult enough. Also
transmission development routes are enforceable by easement legislation.
The transmission owner is not responsible to anyone really for how a
project looks, or how it impacts communities. Provided the project
complies with relevant environmental legislation that's it. Transmission
operators do understand that paying above valuation may be a good idea,
and that has been demonstrated in some depth in negotiations over
Project Energyconnect where some landowers get up to double valuation.
But even so landowners come from a statutorily severely disadvantaged
position. And there is not much fairness, a key concept of social
license, when some landowners lawyer up and some do not or cannot.

# NSW and Victorian price differences seem entrenched for years

Futures prices in NSW and QLD continue to rise.

However it's the difference between Victoria and NSW that's of interest
here, given that these are the two States that nominally are the most
linked by transmission.

During calendar 2021 average net Vic to NSW flow was 385 MW and didn't
rise above 500 MW even when the peak evening price differential averaged
over \$120/MWh.

If NSW pool price in 2023 was the same as in Victoria the NSW pool
revenue would be \$4 bn lower, or over 3 years that's \$12 bn. And even
a little more flow might lower prices in NSW.

AEMO's [Transmission cost report
2021](https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/major-publications/isp/2021/transmission-cost-report.pdf?la=en)
puts the blame squarely in Victoria's side of things where transfer
capacity from Victoria to Southern NSW is limited to 870 MW at peak at
best. The problem with this is, unless I've missed something, its not
due to be fixed until VNI West is built, if its built. NSW gets no
relief until transmission from South Australia arrives or more local
supply is commissioned. Transmission from South Australi will run into a
bottleneck at Wagga which is where Humelink comes in.

# Eraring sharpens the NSW net importer focus

One thing the closure of Eraring does is to heighten NSW's historic
status as a net electricity importer, that is demand is higher than
production with energy being imported from Queensland and NSW.

The NSW Electricity roadmap will, if fully executed, likely make demand
and supply more in balance but in 2022, 2030 is still a long way off.

The NSW transmission augmentation schedule looks as follows:

# RIT tests are nonsense, they obscure the basic questions behind complex unverifiable scenarios.

The traditional regulatory test for consumer paid transmission called
the RIT-T is theoretically perfect enough to satisfy even John Pierce.
In practice though it's a load of old cobblers. In reality by the time
the RIT is undertaken the decision to build the transmission capacity
has already been taken. It is just a discussion of the appropriate route
and the electrical characteristics of the link. And that is more a
technical than economic discussion. In the case of Humelink a 5%
difference in NPVs is regarded as sufficiently material to justify one
route choice over another. This is frankly humorous.. HVDC was dismissed
as 50%-100% more expensive in the PADR. 50% to 100%? In AEMO's
transmission cost database, HVDC for Humelink looks quite good on a cost
basis, although the "benefits" aren't modelled.

Complex NPV models used to justify one transmission route over another
that attempt to predict over 20 or 30 or 40 years what generation mix
will be built if one transmission link is built or not built completely
hide the forest for the trees. Costs and benefits and costs to consumers
are important but financial models aren't meant to be used
deterministically. NPV models generally have wide margins of error at
the best of times and are a decision input not the be all and end all.

Its good judgement that drives good decisions, not easily manipulated,
difficult to verify NPV models about future fuel mixes that are out of
date before they are even published. How does one know what a good
judgement is? Well there's the rub of it.

The ISP is the primary decision input into what transmission is needed
and the order in which it should be built. It is a fair point to be
made, as Bruce Mountain and Ted Woodley make at every opportunity that
the ISP takes a set of State and Federal policies as inputs and then
works out a solution. Certainly Snowy 2 should have been modelled
simultaneously with the ISP, but that is now irrelevant. Similarly if
Queensland Govt eventually decides that actions matter more than words
and stops trying to pretend it can simultaneously decarbonise , meet its
renewable energy targets and keep coal generation open then it may build
new transmission and the ISP will adapt to include that external
decision.

## Humelink and the RIT

Over the next few years the main transmission increase in NSW will come
from EnergyConnect \[SA to Wagga NSW\] and then in moving the supply
from Wagga through to Sydney its "Humelink". Humelink at \$3.3 bn is
basically the same cost as both stages of Marinus Link (\$3.5 bn).![A

Figure 10 Humelink 3C showing Wagga and Snowy legs. Source: Transgrid

Humelink was required to be justified using an RIT-T \[Regulatory
Investment Test\]. The potential owner of the transmission \[Transgrid
in this case\] looks at the investment case for the transmission line
and creates a Net present value \[NPV\] model which compares generation
costs and sometimes competition with the transmission against what the
modeller thinks will happen without it. Then the Australian Energy
Regulator \[AER\] considers the model and takes submissions. If the
model has a positive NPV and its more positive than other options
modelled by the proponent then the AER gives it a conditional tick.

ITK thinks that the models for most of this transmission have little or
no chance of being correct, in the sense that outcomes and
counterfactuals in the real world will not correspond to the modelled
outcomes, and more importantly are totally besides the real point.
Consider project EnergyConnect. Its NPV model assumed that all the gas
generators in South Australia would shut down the day EnergyConnect
opened. That's clearly just a "modelling assumption". The fact that is
obviously not going to happen doesn't invalidate or validate the case
for connecting South Australia to NSW.

So it is with Humelink where the NPV is created by a model that shows
avoided fuel costs and avoided investment if Humelink is built. It's a
model with many assumptions about events far into the future which is
more or less incapbable of being assessed by anyone other than the model
builder. The truth of most big NPV models is that very few people will
ever learn how they actually work, the fudges, plugs and modelling
assumptions that are required usually means that only the one or two
peple that build the model can keep it running and do the sensitivies.
And, in ITK's opinion the models hide the forest for the trees. What
does it really matter if there is less solar and more wind if Humelink
is built? **The real, and pretty much only relevant question is whether
the NSW needs the extra capacity that Humelink provides.** For instance
will the Energy Connect capacity be stranded at Wagga without Humelink?
Will Snowy capacity be available without Humelink? If Snowy is hogging
the transmission can Energyconnect still be useful?

The Humelink Project Assessment Conclusion Report \[PACR\] was prepared
before the draft 2022 ISP was released but under the 2020 version of
"stepchange" it had "net benefits" of \$0.6 bn.. The PACR states:

-   "these benefits are found to be most significant around the time
    large black coal generators are expected to retire and are initially
    driven by an increased utilisation of Snowy 2.0 and changes in
    capacity mix that result in the avoidance of LS battery build in New
    South Wales from 2026/27 "

And one can almost hear Bruce Mountain and Ted Woolley immediately
jumping up and down and banging the drum about why isn't Snowy paying if
it is getting the benefit. I would make a slightly different point which
is its already clear the batteries are going to get built anyway.

In fact about 1800 MW of utility scale battery is already confirmed for
NSW, equal to 90% of the power that Snowy 2 will be capable of and all
of it will be built long before Snowy 2 is up and running. Duration
though will be short. More batteries and eventually pumped hydro are
coming. Residential batteries grow steadily, vehicle to the grid etc.
The batteries don't invalidate Humelink because the reality is that NSW
needs Humelink even though it's a fairly marginal project.

But hands up if this graph convinces you that Humelink is a good or a
bad idea?

There are an infinite number of alternative future paths other than what
is modelled. That's not to invalidate the model or to under estimate its
usefulness. In my opinion though it shouldn't be the sole driver of
whether to build Humelink or which route it should take or the
configuration. And as we will get to the model has no explicit allowance
for carbon or for social license. In this sense it's a giant well
intentioned furphy.

# Transmission provides diversity, insurance and competition

A strong transmission backbone in the NEM increases the resilience of
the NEM by reducing dependence on local sources of power and energy. It
also makes the NEM fairer by increasing inter regional competition. The
history of the NEM shows that when the NSW and Victorian markets were
brought together in the original Hilmer/Coag reforms of the early 1990s
that NSW and Victorian coal generators competed strongly against each
other to the benefit of consumers and the detriment of generators.

In a different world NSW could build lots of batteries and pumped hydro
and have less interstate transmission capability. ITK believes that such
an outcome would likely eventually lead to a few big players running the
NSW market to consumers detriment. Of course that can happen NEM wide
but the bigger the market the harder it is for an oligopoly to emerge.

Transmission provides both capacity and energy. In that sense its
dispatchable power.

## Transmission is a relatively minor part of electricity costs, the costs to consumers of over building transmission are minor

The draft ISP summarises the overall picture for transmission
development in the NEM as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

If the transmission isn't built but coal generation retirements happen
anyway, then its argued in the ISP there is a need for much more local
wind, solar and firming generation to be built and then post 2030 lots
more gas.

## New England REZ, Sydney ring and Marinus Link add the most value

The results from the draft ISP show that Humelink and VNI West have
lower benefit to cost ratios than other actionable projects. We
calculated gross benefits as the net benefit, as disclosed in the ISP
less costs. The Sydney Ring cost is an average of North and South
options but it will either be one or the other. Marinus Link provides
surprisingly high benefits. It has the second highest benefit to cost
ratio and the highest absolute gross benefits. That was not the result I
was expecting. And it is not one that Snowy management would agree with.
Snowy disagrees that wind in Tasmania adds value in the way the ISP
models things.

One might also imagine that despite what Bob Brown and his cheer squad
say the overall social license cost for Marinus Link is low relative to
VNI West and Humelink. Most of the project is under water and until it

**From the point of view of social license its arguably materially more
difficult to build lots more of everything except transmission than it
is to build the required transmission.** Lots more disruption to many
more people from the no transmission case. More gas generation will mean
more gas field development. Again all of this may not come true but in
my view its plausible enough. Guaranteeing the reliability of any one
State is likely to take a lot more redundancy if done with local
resources only as compared to the case of being able to bring in other
States as needed. The first rule of portfolios is basically that the
more diversified the lower the variance of the return.

Equally we can roughly look at the annual cost relative to current final
costs paid by consumers

# Social license, requires a license fee

Australia has a fundamentally divisive regime that divides property,
mineral resources and access rights between the State, the land owner
and the utility.

Broadly: Mineral rights below ground belong to the crown. People wishing
to extract mineral rights obtain licensees from the crown and then have
a right of access to the land subject to paying access costs. But look
at the coal seam gas \[CSG\] experience to notice how this doesn't
always make landowners happy and the industry evolved so that landowners
get significant additional payments and in some cases the CSG developer
bought the underlying property. Note that the QLD CSG industry is fully
electrified and this requires gas and power lines laid in trenches right
across the impacted area. Its actually a text book example of how to do
it with minimal environmental impact but lets not go there. In fact from
a visual perspective, and I speak from personal experience, it's the
electricity transmission that is the most visually intrusive element.

By contrast wind and solar farm developers have no natural rights to the
land on which they seek to locate their wind turbines and or solar
panels and so they must negotiate land rental fees. Over time and in
order to improve social license additional fees have often come to be
paid to land owners that feel they are impacted even if the wind turbine
is not located on their property. In addition there are community funds
and similar.

Finally electricity transmission access is granted by way of easement:

"An easement is the right to enter or use a section of land for a
particular purpose by someone who is not the land owner. 

Transmission line easements can generally be defined as the lots of land
on which transmission overhead and underground lines are built and
include a buffer area to ensure the safe and secure operation of the
lines."

The extent of transmission easement width wise is shown below although
the left most tower doesn't make much intuitive sense to me.:

The easement process is either a negotiated outcome based on the value
of the land or if that fails it can be compulsorily acquired under the
terms of the "Just Terms Act" with the valuation determined by the
valuer general in NSW or ultimately by the Land and Environment Court.
In the case of Humelink we are talking about 500 kv double circuit.

## Contemporary compensation comparison

How does the compensation between wind farms and transmission compare.
In terms of the bargaining power in the case of the wind farm its kind
of equal but the land owner can refuse point blank. In the case of the
easement the transmission operator has all the bargaining power, its
only a question of what the land owner can negotiate.

### Windfarms

ITK understands that the going rate for wind farms is about \$6k/MW so
for a 5 MW or 6 MW turbine that's \$30k per year. And so for say Bango
WF of 46x5.3 MW turbines that's about \$1.4 m and we could add in a bit
for the transmission from the wind farm to the grid so say \$1.5 m per
year. Then we need to add in the community enhancement fund of \$130 k
per year. So from the wind farm's perspective the annual cost is \$1.63
m per year. If I use a 7.5% discount rate and ignore tax then the
present value is about \$19 m which works to maybe 3.5% of the cost of
the wind farm. Per wind tower the NPV is about \$350K (present value of
\$30k per year for 25 years @ 7.5% discount rate). From the landowner's
perspective one can either look at the direct land use or the total land
use. According to NREL the direct land use is about 0.75 acres/MW. That
is the area occupied by turbines, access roads, substations and the
like. Because turbines are often located on hills the total land area
consumed can be larger. However the broader point of view is that such
land is inherently less valuable. For this reason the sums I do take the
direct land use.

Also of note is that the land owner still owns the land, and will get it
back after 25 years, unless a new lease is negotiated. Agricultural
activity will be possible on the windfarm, but the height of the tower
at 120 metres is 70% more than a 500 kv double circuit transmission
tower..

From a financial analyst perspective the land rental cost works
\$2.20/MWh or maybe 1/6 of total annual operating costs. Ok.

### Transmission

Humelink is not yet up to acquiring easements but from the PACR we can
see that about \$91 m has been estimated for land easements. This works
to \$250k per linear km but only 70 metres wide. There are about 2.5
towers per km, so around \$100 k per tower. That is a one off cost as
opposed to the annual payment made to the wind farmer.

###  Wind farms per sq metre of land are paid perhaps 6x what transmission gets

I have tried to convert the wind farm and transmission payments into the
price paid to permanently acquire the land expressed in \$/M2

### Easements costs are low relative to total costs

For Humelink Transgrid estimates the easement cost at \$90-\$100 m out
of a total cost of \$3.3 bn.
