## Stegra - Sweden leads the world

Despite all my skepticism there is a scale (5mtpa) green steel plant being built in Sweden by [Stegra](https://stegra.com/news-and-stories/h2-green-steel-raises-more-than-4-billion-in-debt-financing-for-the-worlds-first-large-scale-green-steel-plant) and commercial operations are planned as soon as 2026. That plant has €6 bn of capital consisting of €2 bn of equity and 80% debt.

The Stegra plant has three components and it's the first, a 700 megawatt electrolyser thats of the most interest. Second the hydrogen is mixed with the particular iron ore to produce iron. The warm iron (sponge iron if you like) then goes into a traditional electric arc furnace (EAF)

The Stegra plant will use iron ore pellets from Vale. By and large traditional Australian iron ores are unsuited to pellatisation. Rio is also supplying some pellets from its Canadian operations (who know)

The PEM (membrane) hydrogen electrolysis capacity is being build by thyssenkuip nucera. The process is described as alkaline water electrolysis (AWE)



## Fossil fuel exports do little for the Australia's budget, but income tax from iron ore is a major driver

It's reasonably well known that no matter what the coal or gas price it has little impact on the budget. That's because coal and gas producers dont seem to pay much tax, particularly gas producers.

On the other hand every time the Australian budget deficit is discussed the iron ore price is regarded as an important input. We looked into it and all the impact of iron ore on the deficit comes through income tax receipts. The fact is that the tax BHP/RIO/FMG pay is material to the budget. In a way that's how it should be since Australia dominates global iron ore production.

## Steel making 

This section draws heavily on BHP documentation

> Iron ore is composed of iron oxides and other impurities. To turn it into steel, it goes through:
>
> 1. **reduction,** where the iron compounds in the ore undergo chemical reactions with carbon and/or hydrogen at a high temperature to convert them into metallic iron.
>
> 2. **melting,** where all the metallic iron and impurities are heated until they melt completely. The impurities that resisted reduction (mostly silica and alumina, which are referred to as ‘gangue’) form a molten slag that floats on the molten iron. The two liquids can then be separated easily.
>
> 3. **refining,** which removes excess reduced elements that are dissolved in the molten iron, such as carbon, phosphorus and sulphur, to meet the required steel specifications.
>
> These are not the only steps, but they are the key ones.
>
> Through the BF route, **reduction** and **melting** are both achieved inside the BF itself, and **refining** is performed in a separate Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF). Through the ESF route and EAF route, the DRI unit that feeds these furnaces only performs **reduction** without melting, so all the impurities remain in the solid DRI which must be subsequently melted and refined to remove them

In more detail:

##### Raw Materials and Iron Ore Preparation

- **Iron Ore**: Typically hematite (Fe₂O₃) or magnetite (Fe₃O₄)
- **Coke**: A form of carbon made from coal, used as both a fuel and a reducing agent
- **Limestone**: (Calcium carbonate, CaCO₃) acts as a flux to remove impurities

These materials are **crushed**, **sorted**, and sometimes **sintered** (partially fused into lumps) to improve their efficiency in the blast furnace.

##### Blast Furnace Operation

A **blast furnace** is a tall, steel structure lined with refractory brick. Here's what happens inside:

**Loading:** Layers of iron ore, coke, and limestone are added from the top.

**Air Injection:** Hot air ("**blast**") is blown into the bottom through nozzles (tuyeres). This air is preheated to ~1000°C.

**Chemical Reactions:**

- **Combustion**: C (coke) + O₂ → CO₂
- **Reduction**: CO₂ + C → 2CO and Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂

Carbon monoxide reduces iron ore to **molten iron** (called **pig iron** or **hot metal**).

**Fluxing:** Limestone decomposes to calcium oxide: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ Calcium oxide reacts with silica (SiO₂) and other impurities to form **slag**, which floats on top of the molten iron.

##### Tapping the Furnace

- **Pig Iron** is drained from the bottom at ~1500°C
- **Slag** is removed separately and often used in construction materials

##### Steelmaking: Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF)

Pig iron from the blast furnace is high in carbon (~4%), so it must be refined to become steel.

**Process:**

- Pig iron is poured into a **Basic Oxygen Furnace**
- **Scrap steel** is often added for cooling and recycling
- A **high-pressure stream of pure oxygen** is blown into the molten iron

**Reactions:** Oxygen reacts with carbon, silicon, manganese, and phosphorus to form oxides. These oxides either burn off as gas (like CO, CO₂) or are captured in the slag.

This reduces the carbon content to 0.1–1%, depending on the desired steel grade.

##### Casting

The purified molten steel is poured into molds in one of two ways:

- **Ingot casting**: poured into large molds to solidify
- **Continuous casting**: steel flows into a cooled mold and solidifies as it's drawn downward into slabs, billets, or blooms

##### Finishing

These semi-finished steel forms are **rolled**, **shaped**, and **heat-treated** to make:

- Sheets
- Bars
- Pipes
- Structural beams
- Wire

Additional alloying elements (like chromium, nickel, molybdenum) may be added to form specialty steels (e.g., stainless steel).

Putting this into a diagram with the aid of Claude I get.
