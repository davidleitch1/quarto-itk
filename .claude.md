## Two-Stage Proofreading Workflow for .md Files

### Stage 1: Grammar and Spelling Check

When asked to proofread a .md file:

1. Read the entire file using the Read tool
2. Identify ALL errors including:
   - Spelling mistakes
   - Grammar errors
   - Duplicate/repeated words (e.g., "the the", "game game")
   - Missing apostrophes in contractions (e.g., "its" vs "it's", "wont" vs "won't")
   - Incorrect word usage (e.g., "less" vs "fewer" for countable nouns)
   - Missing articles (a, an, the)
   - Extra spaces between words
   - Double punctuation (e.g., "..")
   - Missing words that affect sentence structure
   - Broken markdown formatting

3. Present ALL proposed changes as a numbered list with checkboxes:
   ```
   **Error #1:**
   - Line X: "original text"
   - **Proposed change:** "corrected text"
   - **Reason:** Brief explanation
   
   Do you approve this change? (yes/no)
   ```

4. Process each approval/rejection sequentially
5. Apply all approved changes using MultiEdit tool in a single operation
6. Save the file with the same name
7. Generate a final change log summarizing all applied corrections

### Stage 2: Readability and Clarity Review

After grammar/spelling corrections:

1. Re-read the corrected file
2. Identify issues with:
   - Unclear or ambiguous phrasing
   - Concepts that need better explanation
   - Logical flow problems
   - Technical terms used inconsistently
   - Sentences that are hard to parse
   - Missing context that would help readers

3. Present these as suggestions for the author to consider
4. Only make changes if explicitly approved

## Important Notes

- Always use MultiEdit for multiple changes to the same file
- Preserve the author's writing style and voice
- Don't add comments or documentation unless requested
- Focus on correctness and clarity, not stylistic preferences
- For technical articles, assume readers have industry knowledge unless told otherwise
