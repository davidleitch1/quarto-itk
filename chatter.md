Going forward articles will include a comments section. No login is required at this stage as the traffic volume is expected to be low. Comments are generally welcome.

Updating some previous numbers the going rate for a 6 MW wind turbine seems about $60k per year. So the 54 turbines of  Doughboy windfarm  that 9 landowners turned down is about \$3.2 m or \$97 m over 30 years. Lots of money to give up for any reason. Things must be good in the bush although my understanding 6/9 potential hosts weren't even residents.

Whitehaven reported coal production costs of A$114/t. Price received for NSW thermal coal of US\$137/t (A\$210/t). That's likely for top quality thermal coal (26 gj/t)  but even so translating that back to NSW coal generation for say Eraring gives 9.5 GJ/MWh * 210 / 26 = \$76/MWh fuel cost.

## CIS scheme webinar

- Not a lot of real news but well attended plenty of Q&A. In response to my question about will it get new capacity built there seems to be a general focus rather than specific provisions. Ie choosing projects that are capable and will be built. Comes down to who is doing the administering. 
- Focus on getting the right number of bidders as the assement process will take months, and too many will slow it down.
