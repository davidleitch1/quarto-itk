## Either force Gentailers to fund wind and solar via PPAs or cut them out permanently

It's been clear for years and years that the major gentailers dont want to either own, finance or write PPAs for wind and solar.  The gentailers will nickel and dime any CIS or Nelson style contracts until the private sector's role is meaningless.

The only way to get to Gentailers to write wind or solar PPAs is by some form of mandatory share of renewable energy, REC certificates are the most market like way,  Since the Nelson Committee has been given the word that certificates are out this leaves only one choice. Get rid of any pretence about the Gentailers. The Goverment is going to be on the hook so it might as well do the job properly. And the, to me, obvious way to do that is via vanilla CFDs with say a 20 year term. If done on a regular schedule the Government will end up paying on average the correct price. Developers still take financing, construction and operational risk. Once built the assets can be resold into an infrastructure fund offering infrastructure style returns. 

In this scenario the Government's problem is it will pay LCOE but receive spot and that is exactly what Gentailers have been seeking to avoid. However if the Goverment has PP

## Gentailers have been on a buyer's strike for years

##### Origin Energy

Origin has not announced any wind or solar PPAs in the past 5 years. Zero, zilch nothing. Its last purchases were for its own development Stockyard Hill where it wrote a PPA in order to make the project saleable. And before that Darling Downs Solar farm.

Origin is also kind of playing the NSW Govt for a fool. It has a no risk insurance policy to get a return on Eraring if conditions go against it and at the same time if electricity prices are high, well its carry on Sergeant Major.

##### AGL

AGL's last PPA was with Rye Park to take 45% of output  where again the deal was done with its 20% owned investment Tilt Energy who owns the project. AGL is believed to have  first rights of refusal over any Tilt Development a good prize for a 20% investment. Those first rights may only apply to projects that existed at the time PARF acquired Tilt and renamed itself. Nothing has ever been disclosed. Before that AGL did a deal with Maoeng in 2017

##### Energy Australia

Surprisingly Energy Australia has announced two deals:

- 40% or around 345 MW of output from Golden Plains stage 2
- 30% of Kidston wind farm (about 77 MW). However I don't believe this project has reached FID and has been reduced in size

So I don't know what readers think but for my money these big gentailers have essentially said to the public "screw you". That would particularly be the case for Origin. It's true you can cut them some slack because of the aborted Brookfield takeover but the fact is Origin despite many fine words has never really been there for wind or solar. Far better to go successfully gambling on  Octopus Energy  than to roll the sleeves up and offer Australians the products they actually need.

Origin will point to its investment in Delta Yanco wind farm for which it may end up paying as much as \$300 m but that's just one project. To replace the 15 TWh of annual output from Eraring needs say 5 GW of wind or more of solar. 

AGL is just as bad. The company had the nerve to print its renewable share of generation was around 20% in FY25. This at a time when including rooftop solar the broader NEM is at close to 40%. 

I have also long argued that it's such a hopeless cultural job. Where is the marketing appeal in the product offering?

In AGL's case  coal generation is around 30 TWh per year earning probably around \$1.1 bn of ebitda, maybe more, maybe less, but in terms of cash flow its certainly a lot less because around \$400-\$500 m of maintenance capital expenditure is being spent a year. So at that rate and with AGL's coal generation current scheduled to completely close within 10 years the company will have spent maybe \$4 bn on completely dead assets with no future. I get that there is a positive NPV in the process but I still can't help thinking what a waste.

## Nelson review turns blind eye to problem

I quote from the Nelson review executive summary p 11.

> Historically, significant investment in electricity infrastructure has rarely occurred without some form of government support. The most prominent example of this government support has been the Renewable Energy Target (RET) which has historically delivered the vast majority of investment in small-scale and large-scale renewable resources. However, policies such as the RET have substituted coal-based energy with renewable-based energy, without any additional requirements to provide the other services consumers need, namely:
>
> • Shaping: Moving electricity to the time of day it is needed
>
> • Firming: Long-duration dispatchable capacity to deliver extra energy as needed
>
> • Essential system services: Securing and stabilising the grid with a range of services, including frequency control, voltage regulation, system strength and inertia.
>
> The CIS and state-based interventions such as the New South Wales Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap are the current policy instruments for de-risking private investment. But these policies sit adjacent to, rather than within, the market’s structure which is articulated through the NEL and NER.
>
> In the absence of a nationally consistent replacement for the CIS, investment will be driven by state- based schemes, resulting in a more complicated and fractured investment landscape, which may fall short of what the system needs.
>
> The first and most persistent of the barriers to new investment is the ‘tenor gap’: a mismatch between the long‑term contracts needed by sellers to finance capital-intensive assets (often 10 to 30 years) and the short-term contracting of buyers (typically three to seven years). This tenor gap is driven by a broad suite of uncertainties – technological, regulatory and demand-related.

Not to put too fine a point on it I regard this as largely garbage.

The most obvious evidence is batteries. Each of Energy Australia, AGL and Origin are happily building batteries on balance sheet and also contracting output from other batteries. On balance sheet batteries have a life of say 20 years, and increasing. This clearly shows the big gentailers are happy as taking tenor risk. You can bet a bunch of money that if Snowy had spare balance sheet capacity it too would be building batteries.

And the idea that gentailers dont have  any certainty about a load into which to sell PPA output is also unsupported by any evidence in the Nelson review. I mean just think about it:

> "the tenor gap is driven by a broad range of uncertainties - technological, regulatory and demand related"

Personally I'd like to see the comittee adduce some evidence as to those uncertainties, which as far as I looked, was not provided. But equally the fact that market structure, ie a big fat oligopoly of coal owning gentailers correctly aiming to maximise NPV of their assets is completely ignored. And I think this is unreasonable and makes it hard for me to take the committee report seriously.

Secondly two of the big gentailers have built gas generators in recent years. AGL with Barker's inlet and EA with Tallawarra stage B

Looking further back, and perhaps fundamentals  have  changed although in this regard I would argue not, each of AGL, ORG and EA was happy to own long term coal generation and as far as I can tell happy to take the tenor risk of operating it as long as possible.

Finally the gentailers havent even been signing short term PPAs. 

You can also read in the above quote the review authors' fondness for the LRET scheme instead of replacing it with the CIS.

## An alternative explanation.

In ITK's keyboard warrior view the strike by AGL, EA and Origin results from other factors including:

- Cost of wind development has increased sharply so the wind PPA market doesn't clear. I think the evidence for the increase in the cost of wind is abundant and it's well known that rapidly increasing costs cause sticker shock and cause deals to be delayed. Contrary evidence is that Gentailers stopped taking an interest in wind long before the big Russia induced cost increases.
- Return on equity for stand alone utility solar has been compromised by initially understimated competition from the rooftop solar market;
- The absence of an increase in the RET obligation removes the stick that drove gentailers to sign PPAs.  Origin for instance had a long standing policy of having enough REC cover for its mass market load, and an increasing REC percentage would have lead to them signing the bare minimum of new PPAs required.

Still these are only my ideas. If you look at the history ORG has never had any interest in renewable energy Grant King used to sneer at the returns while blowing money on high return high risk projects. Michael Fraser and Jerry Maycock took AGL from being a leader in the Australian wind space to Australia's largest carbon emitter. Maycock had already shown at CSR that he was a very poor judge of the what was in shareholders' long term interests. Fraser simply didn't care that much. I doubt if he understood carbon policy and risks, if he did he was certainly prepared to sacrifice long term credibility for a short term deal.

Energy Australia is just crippled by the CLP ownership..

So in that sense my prior was always that management and the Board never regarded it as their duty to do their bit. Talk by all means, have a nice section in the Annual Report, show up at conferences and say nice things but actually do nothing. Run as dead as possible.

## Since the Government has to do the financing due to Gentailers being unwilling lets stop pissing round.

The CIS scheme, I think is a pretty good scheme, but its designed with the idea that wind and solar developers will need not just a CIS contract but a contract with, most likely a gentailer, to provide the equity return on the project.

The Nelson review has some variation on this where once they work out what the contracts actually look like they then require developers to get a short term PPA with your friendly gentailer.

But why do any of this? Gentailers have made it abundantly clear they don't want to be involved with wind or solar. Because they are unwilling they will have to be forced into it and that's just going to delay the whole process.

Both the CIS and the proposed Nelson Contracts represent attempts to provide Govt assistance but preserve the market. No matter how cleverly designed such schemes inevitably lead to the Govt picking winners according to more or less disclosed criteria and bid prices.

The effect is the exact opposite of what the Nelson review wants, namely liquidity and transparency. 

## Whats wrong with a vanilla CFD?

CFD PPAs as issued by the ACT and Victorian Governments are contracts where the buyer, in this case the Federal Govt agrees to pay a fixed price per unit of energy produced by the project developer over the contract period, the longer the contract the lower the price required.

They fell out of favour because (1) they represent Govt intervention, (2) The Goverment might agree to pay too much. Subsequent schemes like LTESSAs and CIS were more designed to derisk projects from the developer's perspective whilst still leaving  as much as possible to private negotiations in the contract market

But I would argue that without some element of compulsion the gentailers just aren't there.

So instead of a CIS or some fancy new contract lets have the Goverment just issue plain old vanilla CFDs. 

If the spot price is below zero then that can be excluded.

By holding auctions regularly say every 3 months a form of "dollar cost averaging" can be achieved meaning that on average the Government will pay the appropriate market price. Competition amongst developers to get a PPA generally ensures that prices are appropriate.

Clearly the Goverment has to decide on the appropriate technology mix of wind and solar and maybe firming but that is no different to what happens now.

The energy can still be traded in the spot market. Of course the Gentailers will then have to buy out of the spot market, or they can compete with the Goverment for new supply, or they can as the Nelson Committee wants negotiate to buy contracts from the Goverment.

What I propose is not all that different, as far as I can tell from Nelson style contracts except there is less BS. Of course there have to be penalties for not starting any contract awarded by the due date.
